 * shift before the `tie` token closes everything and drops the rest), the
 * `next_seek_time` window, and retriggers. Spec'd in docs/TOKENIZER.md
 * section 3.

 * actions, and prelude forcing reads `openKeys()` at each boundary to build the
 * next chunk's forced prologue. One state machine serving both is what keeps
